This is a plugin for the [BitBar app](https://getbitbar.com).

To get this up and runnig, put the `jenkins.2m.js` in your plugin folder, change the jenkins URL, then in your terminal :
```bash
cd your/bitbar/plugin/folder
chmod +x jenkins.2m.js
npm install node-fetch q
```
And you're done !

If you want to change the refresh interval, you can do it just from the file extension (see [BitBar's doc](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar#configure-the-refresh-time) for more information)
